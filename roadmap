# Boid
    - Maybe the boids could also have random "uniqueness" factors, which are multiplied to the global characteristics, for example, some boids may be faster than others, or some boids may apply different weights to certain behaviours.
    - The boids should only be influenced by boids in their field of view (not those behind them)

# GUI
    - There should be folders for each boid type, where the settings (and behavious) for that type can be changed. Basically, the .xml structure will be copied to the GUI.
    - The different behaviours will also be toggable.
